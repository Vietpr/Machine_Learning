# House Price Prediction Project
# Introduction
Hello everyone! Welcome to the Housing Price Competition project using Machine Learning. The main objective of this project is to apply Machine Learning techniques to predict housing prices based on various related features. It's an exciting project that offers a hands-on experience with real-world data and the opportunity to build predictive models.

# Project Overview
In this project, we work with a dataset containing housing prices, encompassing a wide range of information including area, geographical location, number of bedrooms, surrounding amenities, and several other factors that contribute to predicting house prices. Our project involves the following key steps:

1. Data Collection and Exploration
Initially, we gather the data from the source and delve into understanding its underlying structure. This includes identifying crucial features and exploring the intricate relationships that exist between them.

2. Data Preprocessing
Given the reality of imperfect data, we execute data preprocessing to address missing entries, eliminate noise, and standardize the data into a suitable format for model training.

3. Data Splitting
The data is partitioned into distinct training and test sets, which enables us to comprehensively assess the model's performance.

4. Model Construction
We employ a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to construct models capable of predicting housing prices.

5. Model Evaluation
The efficacy of our models is measured through key metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared, and other relevant evaluation techniques.
